## Build
First clone the project (submodules are included):
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/empitrix/assembler
```

for GNU make use:
```bash
make
```

If you are using [`mingw`](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) for windows you can use:
```bash
make windows
```

After that, there will be a `assembler` file, or `assembler.exe` in windows.


## Usage
After compiling run the `assembler` followed by given assembly file!
for example:
```bash
./assembler ./test/gpio.asm
```
after that if everything goes well you have a `asm_out_bin` file which is contains binary data of given assembly file.
